# Shopping-List
Built as a premade shopping list where user can add, remove, swap, and sort items on the list. 
Python code was used to create this list which is included in this repository.
Some challanges that were faced was marking an item on the list as done and some features that I hope to implement in the future is to have an outline/template that makes it an actual list.

The shopping list comes with items already on the list, but you have an option to remove these items and the code will ask you for your option to do what you want with the list and this includes adding items, viewing the current list, marking an item as done/acquired, removing an item from the list, removing all items from the list, sorting the list alphabetically, counting the number of items on the list, and exiting the program.
